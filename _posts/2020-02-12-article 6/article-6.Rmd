| General topic?               | PCB’s are toxic substance which is synthesize by industries, it used to make the paint black. Nowadays it’s forbidden in Europe but it still to influence the marine life like porpoise. The female porpoise are infected by PCB then it suckle its calves and the calves are infected by PCB too. But PCB make big damages at the brain of the porpoise calves  |
| Procedure/what was examinated? | They analyzed the PCB and its effects in some family of cetacean. Its effect on the development of the young whales. They tried to monitor the PCB concentration in the sea. They analyzed the effect on the porpoise to saw the effect on species who are in extinction like orcas. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | First the scientist found that there are 209 type of PCB and all that type make a neurotoxic cocktail. They found that the PCB are dangerous for the development of the brain of porpoise calves. PCBs are in the milk of the whales and they pass it to the calves but not also. If an animal have PCB in it its predator will eat it and have the PCB. So in the food chain the main predator will have a lot of PCB. They tried to monitor the PCB but it’s impossible because there are a lot of mixing of PCBs and every PCB are different.  |
| Remaining questions?         | They don't know all effects of the PCB on the marine life neither how stop this.   |
