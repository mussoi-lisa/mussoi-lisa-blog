| General topic?               |  The resistance of the kelp to the climate's change.                       |
| Procedure/what was examinated? |
In 2014, the temperature increase in California. Laminaria are found in Northern California and the same species in Southern California. The southern kelp died while the northern kelp survived. So scientific research has been looking at whether the kelp could survive climate change such as ocean acidification or rising temperatures. So they are testing the development of kelp in different waters. They are focusing their study on the giant kelp at an early stage of its development because it is at this stage that environmental changes are most sensitive. The researchers are testing different water pH values on the kelp to simulate ocean acidification and upwelling.|
| Conclusions/discovery?       | They discovered that high altitude kelp kills kelp and that temperature kills Northern California kelp and prevents them from reproducing. And they found that pH doesn't interfere with kelp reproduction and doesn't kill kelp.   |
| Remaining questions?         | |
