| Researchers                  | Marilyn Brandt, works  at the St. Thomas campus of the University of the Virgin Islands with her scientist team. Karen Neely works at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale. Amy Apprill works at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. Laura Mydlarz she is a immunologist at the University of Texas at Arlington.               |
| Published in?                | August 29, 2019                                                       |
| General topic?               |  Coral disease in Caribbean's sea                     |
| Procedure/what was examinated? | They found coral's disease near Florida and near Caribbean's islands. They think that warming water and overfishing are very bad for corals because warming water is good for the developpement of bacterias and  overfishing can stress corals and they can be weaker so be sick faster. Corals can bleach too. It's the major cause of the corals decline because they eject their symbiose's alguae. To find the source of the microbe, the scientists analysed the one who lived in water near the coral and they analysed other animals in a lab with the sick coral. Mydlarz had made the corals believe that they were infected by a bacteria and she saw that they made new cells but the heatly coral, when it dies, remains still in state of die cell. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | They found that the disease is countagious and that  pollution can cause the disease. The disease is called Skittle-D and the scientists  found that it's cause by more than one pathogene. They found that the immune systeme of sick coral is different from the healthy coral's immune systeme.     |
| Remaining questions?         |They found some solutions. They thought of a antibiotic pasta to slather and put one healthy coral between 2 sick corals but they don't know if it can work on the long term. Coral reefs are very important in the marine ecosysteme and the Skittle-D can spread very fast and very easily so they don't know how stop these disease. They analysed the coral reef near Porto Rico and they saw that the coral has the with plague so it's less severe that Skittle-D.  |
