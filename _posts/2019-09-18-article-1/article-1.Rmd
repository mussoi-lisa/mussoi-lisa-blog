| Researchers                  | Chelsea Harvey, she is an environmental journalist who covering in climat's search                       |
| Published in?                | July 15, 2019                                                       |
| General topic?               |  The effect of iron's particle on the developpement of phytoplakton                      |
| Procedure/what was examined? | Nowadays, a lot of micro particle of iron are in the ocean. The phytoplankton is the begin of the food chain so if there aren't phytoplankton there aren't marine's life. Scientist think that an iron fertilization are good for less iron zone, they think that's good for the developpement of the phytoplankton.So they tried a dozen of experiments on a little population of phytoplankton. But if there are a lot of phytoplankton,it can induce a developpemnt of toxic algae, some fish car eat this algae and die.So it can be influence the marin's ecosysteme badly.The iron's particuls who product human are different of the iron pariculs of sand, they dissolve more easily. Some scientist tried to dumped iron's partcle to raise up the salmon population but probleme still the same. Now the pollution still a probleme and iron still to release in the ocean and we don't know the true effect. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | They found that the fertilazation of plankton are more effective in iron-limited water. They discovered that the plankton can absorbe the CO2 but they estimed that the plankton can absorbe 1 gigatone per years and the emition of human it's 11 gigatone per years. The question still open we know that th eiron fertilization can help improve pollution problems but it can have a lot of consequences on marin's life.        |
| Remaining questions?         | We know that it's a solution but it can do worse than better. We don't know what it's the right effect on marin's life.  |
