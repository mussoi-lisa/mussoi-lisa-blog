| Researchers                  | (Chelsea Harvey, she is an environmental journalist who covering in climat's search)                        |
| Published in?                | (July 15, 2019)                                                       |
| General topic?               |  (The effect of iron's particle on the developpement of phytoplakton)                      |
| Procedure/what was examined? | (Nowadays, a lot of microparticle of iron are in the ocean. The phytoplankton is the begin of the food chain so if there aren't phytoplankton marine's life. Scientist think that an iron fertilization are good for less iron zone, they think that's good for the developpement of the phytoplankton. But if there are a lot of phytoplankton,it can induce a developpemnt of toxic algae, some fish car eat this algae and die. So it can be influence the marin's ecosysteme badly. Some scientist tried to dumped iron's partcle to raise up the salmon population but probleme still the same. Now the pollution still a probleme and iron still to release in the ocean and we don't know the true effect.) |
| Conclusions/discovery?       |  (what did the researchers conclude? Did they find something?)      |
| Remaining questions?         | (check if there are still interrogations at the end of the article) |
