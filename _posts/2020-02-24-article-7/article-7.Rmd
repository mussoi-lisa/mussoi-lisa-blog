| General topic?               | The low oxygens could temporary blind marine animals like crabs or squid. Especially if the animals are in the larvae state. When an animal is in their larvae states it â€™s in the zooplankton. Zooplankton need to see to see their prey, to hide it or for the migration. But cause of pollution the oxygen level decrease and marine animal could be blind. |
| Procedure/what was examinated? | They exposed animal like crabs or squid at different levels of oxygens and they examined the elicit visual response with electrode that was connect the to retina of the animals  |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | They found that the vision can be reduce by 60 to 100% cause of low oxygen levels. The vision began to decrease at the level of oxygen that are in the surface of ocean. The octopus held out longer than another animals. But when the levels of oxygen increase it recover their slight. |
| Remaining questions?         |They don't how it infect the behavior of animals because they need their vision to the migration or to eat and see their prey.     |
