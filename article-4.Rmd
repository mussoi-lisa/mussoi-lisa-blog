| General topic?               |  the contamination of plastic in the larval fish                      |
| Procedure/what was examinated? | Near Hawa√Ø some scientis observe that there are more larval fish at thesurface slicks. It's was very nice beacause the laval fish developpe with phytoplakton and it's very good for the marin's ecosysteme. But they observed plastic in the stomach's larval fish and in a lot of fish's species. In laval fish the plastic it's harmful but in adult fish it can cause stomach hurt and kill them.|
