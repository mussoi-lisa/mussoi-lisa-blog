In this blog, i'll speak about the activity that I do to learn and perfect my english. First time, I work in a hotel-Restaurant so I speak english with forein people. In september, I went in Dannemark at Copenaghen with friends. So we must speak English all time, at the hotel, in market in restaurant we usually speak with the waiter and with the peolple.
